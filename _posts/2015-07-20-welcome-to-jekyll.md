You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Erlang code:

{% highlight erlang %}
-module(my_handler).

-behaviour(ebus_handler).

%% API
-export([handle_msg/2]).

handle_msg({Channel, Msg}, Context) ->
  io:format("[Pid: ~p][Channel: ~p][Msg: ~p][Ctx: ~p]~n",
            [self(), Channel, Msg, Context]).
{% endhighlight %}
